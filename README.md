# Predicting-Life-Expectancy-using-Machine-Learning

Life Expectancy of a person is a statistical measure of the average time he/she is expected to live, based on several factors. Life Expectancy depends upon factors such as: Regional Variations, Economic Circumstances, Sex Differences, Mental Illnesses, Physical Illnesses, Education, Year of Birth and various other Demographic Factors.

Calculating Life Expectancy will require a sophisticated system that will take into account all these factors. With Machine Learning and services such as IBM Watson this has now become possible.
 The goal of this project is to predict the Average Life Expectancy of people living in a country given certain factors consisting of Social, Economical, Immunization, Mortality Factors.

A typical Regression Machine Learning project leverages historical data to predict insights into the future. This problem statement is aimed at predicting Life Expectancy rate of a country given various features.
For the Life Expectancy prediction, user will have to give input values of various features and after analyzing these features, the Machine Learning model will pass its prediction to the user and also indicate whether the predicted value is Safe Life Expectancy Rate, or the country needs to improve its factors.
